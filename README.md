# svg-map-functionality

## This code is to demonstrate different states data fetched by clicking on an SVG image area

### The use of JSON file is because a scenario didn't have database infrastructure, hence the data is stored in hosted file.

#### In order to run this code, download the files, open the folder in Atom , start 'atom-live-server' and the functional page will open in the browser.
You can open this in any other local server like XAMPP also.
