1. Make JSON file including all data
- or you can start with few data first

2. Use the map svg file and save it to your folder structure.
3. Load this svg file inside your required div.

4. Open the browser, and inspect the SVG file.
5. Match the Map state with Map on Google. In respective state path, add the state name
same as you added in your JSON file.

6. Once you are done with mapping the state, you can now create the function in javascript to fetch
data on respective state click.

7. Next the step is to pass this data, to the html element so its visible.
